1. Thread.stop() is deprecated, bcz, it can stop at any time,
    potentially leaving shared resources in an inconsistent state.


2. Thread.suspense() & resume() also deprecated...these may cause deadlock

3. Nowadays, Thread Groups are used less...bcz mostly using Executor Service

4. With Locks(ReentrantLock)...we can avoid deadlock situation ...with proper lock management
