        /*
         CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier
           - are synchronization aids in Java's java.util.concurrent package, designed for managing concurrency.

         CountDownLatch:-
           - Used to wait for a set of tasks to complete before proceeding.
           - It provides a one-time event that gets triggered when the count reaches zero.
           - the latch cannot be reused
           - The count is set at the time of initialization and decremented by calling countDown()

           Use Case Example:
            - Waiting for multiple services to initialize before starting an application.

         CyclicBarrier:-
           - Used to synchronize a fixed number of threads, making them wait until
             all threads have reached a common barrier point.

           - Can be reused after all threads reach the barrier, making it cyclic.
           - we can provide a optional barrier action (a task) to execute when all threads reach the barrier.

          Use Case Example:
            - Coordinating threads performing phases of a task
              (e.g., a game level where players must wait until all are ready before starting).
